```
2. Create a button for Razorpay <next-starter>/src/modules/checkout/components/payment-button/razorpay-payment-button.tsx

like below



````
import { Button } from "@medusajs/ui"
import { Cart,PaymentSession } from "@medusajs/medusa"
import Spinner from "@modules/common/icons/spinner"
import React, { useCallback, useState } from "react"
import useRazorpay, { RazorpayOptions } from "react-razorpay"

const RazorpayPaymentButton = ({
  session,
  notReady,
  cart
}: {
  session: PaymentSession
  notReady: boolean
  cart: Omit<Cart, "refundable_amount" | "refunded_total">
}) => {
  const [disabled, setDisabled] = useState(false)
  const [submitting, setSubmitting] = useState(false)
  const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState<string | undefined>(undefined)
  const [Razorpay] = useRazorpay();

  const orderData = session.data as Record<string, string>
  const onPaymentCompleted = async () => {
    await placeOrder().catch(() => {
      setErrorMessage("An error occurred, please try again.")
      setSubmitting(false)
    })
  }


  const handlePayment = useCallback(() => {
    const options: RazorpayOptions = {
      callback_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL}/razorpay/hooks`,
      key: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY ?? '',
      amount: session.amount.toString(),
      order_id: orderData.id,
      currency: cart.region.currency_code.toLocaleUpperCase(),
      name: process.env.COMPANY_NAME ?? "your company name ",
      description: `Order number ${orderData.id}`,

      image: "https://example.com/your_logo",
      modal: {
        backdropclose: true,
        escape: true,
        handleback: true,
        confirm_close: true,
        ondismiss: () => {
          setSubmitting(false)
        },
        animation: true,
      },
      handler: async (args) => {
        onPaymentCompleted()
      },
      "prefill": {
        "name": cart?.billing_address.first_name + " " + cart?.billing_address.last_name,
